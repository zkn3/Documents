step 1

Goto Monitoring server in mobaXterm
Go to /etc/prometheus

edit or add url of new server into (vi) prometheus.yml via winscp in notepad 
to avoid the error related to spacing


start the service and check the status

systemctl restart prometheus.service
systemctl status prometheus.service
If the status is inactive then start the services and apache on that server e.g:tdcvlhm31t1
tomeeallstop
tomeeallstart
systemctl start -k httpd


step 2

now check the blackbox service 

crontab -l
ps -ef | grep blackbox


if it running kill it
pkill -u  root -f blackbox
pkill -f blackbox

and then run this command for the blackbox service 
/etc/blackbox/blackbox_exporter/blackbox_cronjob_startup.sh > /tmp/blackbox_logs/blackbox_exporter.log &


then check for the entry into the checkbox 
http://tdcvlvmc12.dsone.3ds.com:9090/targets


blackbox--url of the components
node--no of machines/vm
prometheus--self service

step 3

Add ther certificate from the server to monitering server  

e.g.
scp tdcvlhm31t1.crt root@tdcvlvmc12:/etc/ssl/certs/



step 4

now add the dashboard with two methods
1) by duplicating any of the dashboard of services

add the tiltle name and change the service name
you have to manually added the alerts for al services


In notification add the this data 

Annotations:
Alerting: This state represents service is Down!!!
No Data: This state represents either Server or Blackbox exporter service is Down!!!
OK: This state represents all services are WORKING!!!

In queries change the service name all queries

for alert use when,Or logical operation like 
when last() of query (A 5m ,now) is outside range 199 to 200
or   last() of query (B 5m ,now) is outside range 199 to 200.......continue

2)By copying the dashborad and select the graph option above top right corner 
past from some option select it 

you will find the all alert as it is there just change the server name everywhere
